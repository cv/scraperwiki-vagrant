scraperwiki-vagrant
-------------------

scraperwiki-vagrant is an attempt at automating the bootstrapping and setup of a development server for people who want to hack on ScraperWiki (http://www.scraperwiki.com).

It is not yet working as it should, but gets the basic packages installed. There's a lot more to do. If you'd like to help, check out the Issues tab.
